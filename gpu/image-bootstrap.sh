# disk, never echoed and never passed as an argument: curl reads the Authorization header from its stdin config, so
# `ps` shows nothing. A token is only ever sent to the host in the pinned URL; curl drops it across a redirect to a
# CDN, which is what we want, because the signed CDN link needs no credential.
